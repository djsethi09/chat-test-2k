# Chat test 2000

---

This is just a test to get socket.io, rethinkdb, passport and bcrypt on an express app.

If you are wondering why the client js is simple, it is just because I wanted to write the client with no libraries needed.

TODOS are too many to be counted, but I'd rather go on to a new project

## Install:
- npm install
- start rethinkdb
- node app
- go to localhost:8000
- profit
