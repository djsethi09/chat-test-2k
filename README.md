<p>This is just a test to get socket.io, rethinkdb, passport and bcrypt on an express app.</p>

<p>If you are wondering why the client js is simple, it is just because I wanted to write the client with no libraries needed.</p>

<h3>Install:</h3>
<ul>
<li>npm install</li>
<li>start rethinkdb</li>
<li>node app</li>
<li>go to localhost:8000</li>
<li>profit</li>
</ul>
